# Drivers

## What is a Driver?

A driver represents the individual responsible for carrying out deliveries in the system. Each driver profile includes basic information, license and certifications, vehicle and zone assignments, and operational status. Driver profiles enable the system to match deliveries to qualified personnel, ensure compliance with license requirements, and maintain efficient dispatch workflows.

## Driver List

The Driver List provides a comprehensive view of all registered drivers in your delivery network.

Use the list to monitor driver availability, verify credentials, and manage assignments. The interface includes:

- **Search functionality**: Quickly locate drivers by name, code, or contact details.
- **Filtering options**: Filter drivers by status (Active/Inactive), assigned zones, vehicle type, or license expiry.
- **Sorting capabilities**: Sort by name, code, recent activity, or license expiry date.
- **Quick actions**: Access driver details, edit profiles, or change status directly from the list.

The list displays key information such as driver name, unique code, assigned vehicle, zones, license expiry, and current status for easy reference.

## Create a New Driver

Creating a driver profile requires entering key information across several categories to ensure compliance and operational efficiency.

When creating a driver, you can link the profile to an existing user account. Once you select a user during driver creation, that user automatically becomes a driver and gains access to driver-specific features and applications.

### Basic Information

Provide the driver's identification details including full name, unique driver code (e.g., `DRV-001`), contact information (phone and email), and an optional profile image. The driver code must be unique and follow your organization's naming conventions for accurate tracking and assignment.

### License & Certifications

Enter the driver's license number, type (Standard, Commercial, or Special), and expiry date. The system uses the expiry date to trigger renewal reminders and prevent dispatching unlicensed drivers. Optionally add certifications and skills such as Forklift Certified, Hazmat Training, or Refrigeration Handling to match drivers with specific delivery requirements.

### Assignments & Operational Settings

Assign the driver to a registered vehicle and select one or more service zones where they will operate. Zone assignments restrict delivery assignments to defined areas, improving route efficiency and workload distribution. You can also specify driver preferences, operational notes, and languages spoken for customer interactions.

### Status & Access

Set the driver's operational status (Active or Inactive) and configure whether they can access the driver mobile application. Active drivers are available for delivery assignments, while Inactive status excludes them from dispatch during leave or downtime.

### Validation

The system validates all required fields and enforces business rules. Driver codes must be unique, license expiry dates cannot be in the past, and mandatory fields (name, contact, license number) must be completed before submission. Any validation errors are highlighted for correction.

## Edit an Existing Driver

Driver profiles can be updated at any time to reflect changes in credentials, assignments, or availability.

Common updates include:

- **License renewal**: Update license numbers and expiry dates to maintain compliance.
- **Assignment changes**: Reassign drivers to different vehicles or zones based on operational needs.
- **Contact updates**: Modify phone numbers, email addresses, or contact preferences.
- **Status changes**: Toggle between Active and Inactive status for leave, training, or termination.
- **Certifications**: Add new skills or qualifications as drivers complete training programs.
- **Access control**: Enable or disable driver app access based on role changes.

Editing driver profiles ensures accurate dispatch operations, maintains compliance with licensing requirements, and supports dynamic workforce management. The system retains historical assignment data for reporting and auditing purposes.

::::note
Keep driver profiles updated—especially license and expiry details—to maintain compliance and prevent operational disruptions.

::::tip
Assign zones strategically for optimized routing and balanced workloads. Use consistent naming formats (e.g., `DRV-1001`) for easier management.

::::info
Mark drivers as Inactive instead of deleting them if they are temporarily unavailable. This preserves historical data and allows for easy reactivation.
