### Overview

The Driver Performance module allows administrators and operations managers to monitor, evaluate, and improve the performance of drivers in the logistics system. It provides key insights into how efficiently deliveries are executed, helping identify top performers and areas that require attention.

### What is Driver Performance?

A driver’s performance reflects their ability to complete deliveries efficiently, reliably, and with quality service. This module helps administrators measure delivery outcomes, assess average delivery times, analyze failure rates, and review customer feedback ratings.

It ensures that every delivery contributes to consistent service quality and operational improvement.

### Purpose

The Driver Performance section enables administrators to:

- Monitor delivery execution quality across all drivers.
- Compare drivers based on delivery volume, average delivery time, and customer ratings.
- Identify areas for training, improvement, or recognition.
- Reward top performers and address performance gaps.

Why: Tracking performance ensures fairness, efficiency, and accountability within the delivery network — ultimately improving customer satisfaction and delivery reliability.

### Performance Metrics (KPIs)

At the top of the page, admins can view key performance indicators (KPIs) summarizing overall driver activity and quality.

- **Total Drivers**: Number of active drivers currently being tracked.
- **Total Deliveries**: Total number of completed deliveries within the selected time frame.
- **Avg Delivery Time**: Average time taken by drivers to complete each delivery.
- **Avg Rating**: Average customer rating or feedback score across all deliveries.

Why: These KPIs give an instant snapshot of overall delivery performance and help identify whether operational goals are being met.

### Performance Details

Below the KPIs, a detailed performance table lists metrics for each individual driver. This allows operations teams to assess individual contribution and consistency in delivery quality.

| Column | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Driver Name | Identifies the driver. |
| Completed Deliveries | Total number of successful deliveries completed. |
| Failed Deliveries | Number of deliveries not completed or marked as returned. |
| Average Time | Average time taken per delivery. |
| Average Rating | Customer feedback or service rating (if available). |
| Overall Performance | Summary evaluation (e.g., Excellent, Good, Needs Improvement). |

Why: This breakdown helps administrators and dispatchers track punctuality, reliability, and customer satisfaction per driver.

### Create a Driver Performance report

Use these steps to generate and review driver performance for a specific period and scope.

1) Navigate to Driver Performance
   - Go to Last‑mile Delivery > Driver Performance.

2) Set filters
   - Time Range: Select a preset (Today, 7 days, 30 days) or choose a custom range.
   - Zone/Hub: Narrow results to a specific operating zone or hub (optional).
   - Driver(s): Select one or more drivers, or leave blank to include all.
   - Delivery Type: Filter by service or delivery type if applicable (optional).

3) Apply filters
   - Click Apply/Update to refresh KPIs, charts, and the performance table.

4) Review KPIs and charts
   - Check Total Deliveries, Avg Delivery Time, and Avg Rating to get a quick snapshot.
   - Use trend charts to spot spikes in delays or failures.

5) Analyze the driver table
   - Sort by Completed Deliveries, Average Time, or Overall Performance.
   - Click a driver row to view detailed history (if supported in your tenant).

6) Export or share (optional)
   - Export the current view to CSV for audits, performance reviews, or incentives.

7) Take action
   - Recognize top performers, schedule coaching for underperforming drivers, and adjust routes or training as needed.

:::tip
Save frequently used filters (e.g., a specific zone and monthly range) as a view so you can quickly regenerate the same performance report later.

### Using the Data

Admins can use these insights to:

- Reward top-performing drivers through recognition or incentives.
- Identify delays or failure trends to improve route planning and resource allocation.
- Plan driver training to address recurring operational challenges.
- Enhance customer satisfaction by focusing on drivers with performance issues.

Tip: Regularly export or review the data to support performance evaluations and incentive programs.

### Best Practices

- Review driver performance weekly or monthly to identify emerging trends.
- Encourage customer feedback collection for more accurate performance scoring.
- Use performance data to balance driver workloads and prevent burnout.
- Compare driver metrics across zones or delivery types to optimize operational planning.
- Reward consistent performance to motivate drivers and maintain service quality.
