# On-Demand

## What is On-Demand?

On-Demand delivery orders are immediate shipment requests created and dispatched without prior scheduling. These orders support urgent or same-day delivery requirements, enabling dispatchers to respond quickly to time-sensitive customer needs while maintaining operational flexibility.

## Create an On-Demand Order

Creating an On-Demand order requires the following fields:

### Required Fields

- **Customer Name**: Links the order to the customer account for billing and tracking purposes.

- **Delivery Service**: Determines pricing calculations, time estimates, and zone eligibility for the delivery.

- **Pickup Location**: Origin address where the package will be collected. Must be valid and complete.

- **Dropoff Location**: Destination address where the package will be delivered. Must be valid, complete, and distinct from the pickup location.

- **Paper Type**: Documentation classification associated with the delivery for compliance and record-keeping.

- **Payment Method**: Transaction processing method (Prepaid, Cash on Delivery, Wallet, or Credit Account). Determines billing, settlement, and driver cash collection responsibilities.

- **Unit Size**: Package characteristics including quantity, weight, or volume. Affects pricing calculations, vehicle capacity matching, and service eligibility.

### Driver Assignment

Driver assignment is optional during order creation. Orders can be created first and assigned later when driver availability, workload, or route optimization opportunities are better assessed. This flexibility enables efficient management of urgent orders while maintaining operational control.

## Post-Creation Management

After an On-Demand order is created, dispatchers can access the following:

### Shipment Label

View and print shipment labels containing tracking information, delivery codes, and customer details required for package identification and routing.

### Payment Information

Access payment details including payment method, transaction amount, billing status, and settlement information for payment verification and financial record management.

### Delivery Timeline

Review delivery milestones including order creation time, expected pickup time, estimated delivery time, and actual completion status. The timeline provides visibility into delivery progress and helps identify potential delays.

### Driver Assignment

Assign a driver to the order at any time after creation. This enables dispatchers to review order details, assess driver availability, and make optimal assignment decisions based on current operational conditions. Driver assignment can be completed at any time before delivery begins.
