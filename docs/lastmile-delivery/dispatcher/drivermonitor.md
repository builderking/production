# Driver Monitor

## What is the Driver Monitor Module?

The Driver Monitor Module is a real-time dashboard that allows dispatchers to track, monitor, and manage all drivers. It shows which drivers are online, which are offline, their availability status, and their current assignments. This module helps dispatchers quickly understand which drivers can take new orders and provides easy access to each driver's information.

## Driver Monitor Overview

When the dispatcher opens the Driver Monitor screen, all drivers are displayed in an organized view that separates drivers based on their connection status.

### Online Drivers

Drivers who are online appear in the **Online** section. These drivers are currently connected to the system and available for assignment. Dispatchers can see their real-time status and quickly identify which drivers are ready to accept new orders.

### Offline Drivers

Drivers who are offline appear in the **Offline** section. These drivers are not currently connected to the system. This section helps dispatchers understand driver availability and plan assignments accordingly.

## Driver Details

Clicking on any driver opens their detailed information panel, providing comprehensive visibility into the driver's current status and operational context.

### Driver Profile / Basic Information

Access the driver's profile and basic information, including contact details, vehicle information, and driver identification. This information helps dispatchers verify driver credentials and maintain accurate records.

### Current Assignment or Task

View the driver's current assignment or active task. This includes details about any orders, deliveries, or pickups the driver is currently handling. Dispatchers can see the status of ongoing work and understand each driver's workload.

### Status and Operational Details

Review the driver's current status and any relevant operational details, including availability status, location information, and performance metrics. This information enables dispatchers to make informed decisions about driver assignments and resource allocation.
