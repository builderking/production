# Delivery Order

## What is a Delivery Order?

A Delivery Order is a request to deliver a package or shipment to a customer location. These orders enable dispatchers to schedule and coordinate package delivery to customers, ensuring efficient delivery operations and proper tracking of shipments from origin to destination.

## Create a Delivery Order

Creating a Delivery Order requires the following fields:

### Required Fields

- **Customer Name**: Identifies the customer account receiving the delivery. Links the order to customer records for billing and tracking purposes.

- **Delivery Location**: The address where the package will be delivered. Must be a valid and complete address to ensure accurate driver routing and successful delivery completion.

- **Delivery Type**: Classification of the delivery request that determines service requirements, pricing, and operational procedures.

- **Paper Type**: Documentation classification associated with the delivery for compliance and record-keeping purposes.

- **Payment Method**: Transaction processing method (Prepaid, Cash on Delivery, Wallet, or Credit Account). Determines billing, settlement, and driver cash collection responsibilities.

- **Unit Size**: Package characteristics including quantity, weight, or volume. Affects pricing calculations, vehicle capacity matching, and service eligibility.

### Driver Assignment

Driver assignment is optional during order creation. Delivery orders can be created first and assigned to a driver later when driver availability, workload, or route optimization opportunities are better assessed. This flexibility enables efficient management of delivery requests while maintaining operational control.

## Post-Creation Management

After a Delivery Order is created, dispatchers can access the following:

### Shipment Label

View and print shipment labels containing tracking information, delivery codes, and customer details required for package identification and routing.

### Payment Information

Access payment details including payment method, transaction amount, billing status, and settlement information for payment verification and financial record management.

### Delivery Timeline

Review delivery milestones including order creation time, scheduled delivery time, and actual completion status. The timeline provides visibility into delivery progress and helps identify potential delays.

### Driver Assignment

Assign a driver to the order at any time after creation. This enables dispatchers to review order details, assess driver availability, and make optimal assignment decisions based on current operational conditions. Driver assignment can be completed at any time before the delivery begins.
