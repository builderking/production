# Chat

## What is the Chat Module?

The Chat Module is a communication tool that allows the dispatcher to interact with customers, drivers, and team members through chat conversations. This module ensures smooth communication for updates, issue resolution, and real-time coordination between all involved parties.

## Chat Module Functionality

### Access Existing Conversations

The dispatcher can open any existing chat conversation and continue communication. This allows for seamless follow-up on previous discussions and maintains continuity in customer service and team coordination.

### Add Participants

The dispatcher can add new participants to any chat conversation. This includes drivers, support staff, or other team members. Adding participants enables multi-party communication and ensures all relevant stakeholders are included in important discussions.

### Message Visibility

Any message sent in the chat is visible to all participants, including the customer and the assigned driver. This transparency ensures that all parties have access to the same information, reducing miscommunication and improving coordination.

## Creating Chats from Order Details

### Initiate Chat from Order

From the Order Details screen, the dispatcher can create a new chat by clicking the chat icon. This provides a convenient way to start communication directly from the order context.

### Automatic Customer Linking

A new conversation is automatically created with the customer linked to that order. This eliminates the need to manually search for or add the customer, streamlining the communication process.

### Add Additional Participants

Once the chat is created, the dispatcher can message the customer, and can also add additional participants like drivers if needed. This flexibility allows dispatchers to include relevant team members based on the specific requirements of each order or situation.
