# Remit Collections

## What is the Remit Module?

The Remit Module allows the dispatcher to manage and settle the amount collected by drivers. Whenever a driver collects cash from customers, the dispatcher can review, verify, and remit the collected amount through this module. It ensures proper financial tracking between drivers and the dispatcher, maintaining accurate records of all cash transactions and settlements.

## Remit Collections Overview

The Remit Collections module provides a comprehensive view of driver collections and enables dispatchers to process settlements efficiently. The system displays detailed financial information for each driver, allowing dispatchers to review and verify collection amounts before completing the settlement process.

## Viewing Driver Remittance Details

To view remittance details for a driver, the dispatcher selects a driver from the list. Once a driver is selected, the system displays the following information:

### Total Amount Collected by Driver

This shows the complete sum of all cash amounts collected by the selected driver from customers. This total represents all cash-on-delivery transactions and other cash collections completed by the driver during their assigned deliveries.

### Total Amount Collected by Dispatcher

This displays the total amount that has been collected or verified by the dispatcher for the selected driver. This figure helps track the reconciliation between driver collections and dispatcher verification.

### Total Collection Count

This indicates the number of collection transactions completed by the driver. The count provides visibility into the volume of cash collection activities, helping dispatchers understand the scope of collections for each driver.

### Amount Settled via Wallet

This shows the total amount that has already been settled through the wallet system for the selected driver. This information helps track which portions of collections have been processed and settled, ensuring complete financial reconciliation.

## Processing Remittance Settlement

After reviewing the remittance details for a selected driver, the dispatcher can enter the amount to remit and complete the settlement process. The system processes the remittance, updating the financial records and marking the settlement as complete for the selected driver.
