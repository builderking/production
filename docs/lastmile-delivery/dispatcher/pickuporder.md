# Pickup Order

## What is a Pickup Order?

A Pickup Order is a request to collect a package or shipment from a customer location. These orders enable dispatchers to schedule and coordinate package collection from customers, ensuring efficient pickup operations and proper documentation of collected items.

## Create a Pickup Order

Creating a Pickup Order requires the following fields:

### Required Fields

- **Customer Name**: Identifies the customer account from which the package will be collected. Links the order to customer records for billing and tracking purposes.

- **Pickup Location**: The address where the package will be collected. Must be a valid and complete address to ensure accurate driver routing.

- **Pickup Type**: Classification of the pickup request that determines service requirements, pricing, and operational procedures.

- **Paper Type**: Documentation classification associated with the pickup for compliance and record-keeping purposes.

- **Payment Method**: Transaction processing method (Prepaid, Cash on Delivery, Wallet, or Credit Account). Determines billing, settlement, and driver cash collection responsibilities.

- **Unit Size**: Package characteristics including quantity, weight, or volume. Affects pricing calculations, vehicle capacity matching, and service eligibility.

### Driver Assignment

Driver assignment is optional during order creation. Pickup orders can be created first and assigned to a driver later when driver availability, workload, or route optimization opportunities are better assessed. This flexibility enables efficient management of pickup requests while maintaining operational control.

## Post-Creation Management

After a Pickup Order is created, dispatchers can access the following:

### Shipment Label

View and print shipment labels containing tracking information, pickup codes, and customer details required for package identification and routing.

### Payment Information

Access payment details including payment method, transaction amount, billing status, and settlement information for payment verification and financial record management.

### Pickup Timeline

Review pickup milestones including order creation time, scheduled pickup time, and actual completion status. The timeline provides visibility into pickup progress and helps identify potential delays.

### Driver Assignment

Assign a driver to the order at any time after creation. This enables dispatchers to review order details, assess driver availability, and make optimal assignment decisions based on current operational conditions. Driver assignment can be completed at any time before the pickup begins.
