2. Fill in the following fields:

   - **First Name** and **Last Name**
   - **Email** (must be unique)
   - **(Optional) Avatar** image (JPEG/PNG up to 3 MB).

3. Click **Invite User** . This sends an invitation email to the address you provided. The user must open the email, verify their email address and create their own password.

**When to use Invite User**

Choose Invite User when you want the user to complete the onboarding process themselves.

The user will receive an email invitation. They set their own password and verify their email, ensuring that contact details are correct.

This method is ideal for customers or for staff members who should control their credentials from the start.
