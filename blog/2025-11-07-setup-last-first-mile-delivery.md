## Overview

Last mile delivery refers to the final step of the delivery process where goods are transported from a distribution center to the end customer. First mile delivery, on the other hand, involves picking up goods from the origin point (like a warehouse or store) to a distribution center.

Ondi's comprehensive delivery management system helps you streamline both processes, ensuring efficient operations and satisfied customers.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Access the Delivery Module

Navigate to the **Last Mile Delivery** section in your Ondi dashboard. This is where you'll configure all delivery-related settings.

### Step 2: Configure Delivery Zones

Before you can start accepting delivery requests, you need to set up your delivery zones:

1. Go to **Zones** in the Last Mile Delivery menu
2. Click **Create New Zone**
3. Define the geographic boundaries of your delivery area
4. Set pricing rules for each zone
5. Configure delivery time windows

### Step 3: Set Up Vehicle Types

Define the types of vehicles you'll use for deliveries:

- **Bicycles** - For short-distance, eco-friendly deliveries
- **Motorcycles** - For quick urban deliveries
- **Cars/Vans** - For larger packages and longer distances
- **Trucks** - For bulk deliveries

Each vehicle type can have different capacity limits and pricing structures.

### Step 4: Configure Drivers

Add your delivery drivers to the system:

1. Navigate to **Driver** section
2. Add driver details including contact information
3. Assign vehicles to drivers
4. Set driver availability schedules
5. Configure performance tracking settings

### Step 5: Set Up Pricing

Configure your delivery pricing structure:

- **Zone-based pricing** - Different rates for different geographic areas
- **Distance-based pricing** - Rates calculated based on delivery distance
- **Time-based pricing** - Premium rates for express deliveries
- **Weight/size-based pricing** - Additional charges for oversized items

### Step 6: Configure Delivery Services

Set up different delivery service types:

- **Standard Delivery** - Regular delivery within business hours
- **Express Delivery** - Same-day or next-day delivery
- **Scheduled Delivery** - Pre-booked delivery slots
- **Return Pickup** - Service for handling returns

## Integration with Other Modules

Your delivery business integrates seamlessly with:

- **Warehousing** - Automatic order fulfillment and inventory management
- **Store Front** - Direct integration with your online store
- **Customer Portal** - Real-time tracking for your customers
- **Dispatcher** - Efficient route optimization and assignment

## Best Practices

1. **Start Small** - Begin with a single zone and expand gradually
2. **Monitor Performance** - Use the driver performance dashboard to track efficiency
3. **Optimize Routes** - Leverage the dispatcher's route optimization features
4. **Customer Communication** - Enable SMS/email notifications for delivery updates
5. **Exception Handling** - Set up processes for failed deliveries and exceptions

## Next Steps

Once your delivery business is configured, you can:

- Start accepting delivery requests through the API or customer portal
